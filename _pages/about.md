Hello I'm Sahil Rajpal, Graduated in 2021 (B.E. Computer Engineering) I'm currently working at [Pramga.(Formerly Logisy)](https://bepragma.ai) as a Backend Engineer where I'm working on [1Checkout](https://1checkout.ai) and several other internal services.

## My Journey
 -- is a blend of creativity and technology. I started as a visual artist, sharing my artwork on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sahilrajpal05). However, during the lockdown, my curiosity for coding took flight. I dabbled in HTML, CSS, and JS, driven by the desire to create something unique, though initially without a clear direction.

Everything changed when I stumbled upon the Cabot project. Inspired by its potential, I embarked on building my own version. Thus, [Sitechecker](https://github.com/sahilr05/sitechecker) was born—a project that began as a simple experiment but evolved into a pivotal piece of my portfolio.

Initially, my focus was on frontend development, blending my artistic skills with programming. But as I delved deeper, I discovered a passion for backend development. Django became my tool of choice, and soon I was exploring Docker, Nginx, and asynchronous programming. These technologies fascinated me, and I integrated them into [Sitechecker](https://github.com/sahilr05/sitechecker), enhancing its capabilities and my skill set.

What started as a pastime during lockdown turned into a career-defining project. Sitechecker not only showcased my technical abilities but also caught the attention of several startups, leading to exciting interview opportunities.


### Career Path

When COVID-19 hit, campus placements at my college took a significant downturn. Despite numerous interviews with various startups, I faced rejection after rejection. However, persistence paid off, and I eventually began receiving calls from different companies, leading to multiple offers. I **chose to join** a promising Bangalore-based startup, only to have the **offer rescinded** two days before my start date. 
Devastating? Definitely. **But f-k it we ball!**
<!-- It was a devastating blow, but setbacks often pave the way for new opportunities. -->

I jumped back into the job hunt with renewed determination and soon secured an offer from FactWise on July 8, 2021.

#### FactWise
At the time, I was back in my hometown, so my onboarding at FactWise began on July 12, and I officially started working on July 19. To my surprise, the team lacked senior developers—my only superiors were the Lead PM and the Founder. The initial days were spent immersing myself in the world of Procurement, understanding RFQ, RFI, and RFP processes. Once I had a grasp, we embarked on developing our first module: RFQ Events.

On October 11, 2021, Jeet joined the team. With over 8 years of experience at tech giants like Cisco and Amazon, Jeet's presence was a turning point in my journey. His expertise was invaluable, and I absorbed as much knowledge as I could. Shortly after, Usamah came on board as a senior frontend developer, and we expanded our team with 6-8 brilliant interns from IITs.

As the team grew, so did my responsibilities. Beyond backend development, I stepped into a mentorship role, guiding some of the smartest interns I’ve ever met. Balancing mentorship with my projects, including notifications and purchase orders, was challenging but immensely fulfilling. I was thrust into a dynamic environment where I had to push my limits daily, collaborating with PMs, defining roadmaps, assigning tasks, and leading juniors.

FactWise was a crucible of learning, where I honed my backend skills and developed leadership abilities. I thrived on the challenge of constantly setting the bar higher and surpassing it. However, after a period of rapid growth, I realized I had hit a plateau. I yearned for greater challenges and broader horizons, prompting my decision to leave FactWise and join Pramga.

#### Pragma. (Formerly Logisy)
I joined Pramga on July 19, 2023. My first week was spent exploring 1Checkout, the project I was set to handle, and familiarizing myself with various dashboards. Competing platforms like GoKwik and Shopflo highlighted the importance of a seamless checkout experience. I was surprised to learn that many users abandon their carts when required to input multiple details. Systems like 1Checkout, which auto-populate information and streamline the payment process, can boost conversion rates by over 20%—a remarkable insight.

Initially, I focused on improving code quality and implementing features on the roadmap. As we started onboarding big brands, scalability issues arose. This challenge led me to optimize databases, applications, and asynchronous tasks. The learning curve was steep—I delved into connection pooling, composite indexes, Docker Swarm, and various database internals.

Beyond the technical aspects, I communicated directly with merchants, gaining valuable insights into user experience (UX). This interaction informed my contributions to the roadmap, ensuring our solutions aligned with user needs.

Working at Pramga has been a rewarding experience. The co-founders are some of the best people I've worked with—down-to-earth, fun, and incredibly smart. Their leadership and camaraderie make Pramga an exceptional place to grow and innovate.
